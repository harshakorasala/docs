description : "The following are the best practices for setting up Organisations and Users within Zeotap CDP:"

* Data Residency: All data will reside in the European Union (EU) region unless the customer specifically asks for a different region, which needs to be notified before hand.  

* If all the data must be unified, then ensure to onboard them onto the same organisation. 

* In case of child organisations, data will not be unified across them. This is ideal when:

    * Data is kept separate across countries or brands.

    * Consent is specific to a particular brand or source.

* User Access Management: Make sure to complete the tree mapping of admin and other roles in the client side.
