## What's New in Q4 of 2024?
### 1. Destination Enhancements

The below features are now available in the Destinations module of Zeotap CDP.


<Update label="1.1 Introduced Enrichers in Destination Mapping" description="21-12-2024">

This new feature enhances the flexibility of mapping attributes and identifiers while sending data to destination platforms. Use this feature when you need to modify, customise, or enrich the data sent to your chosen destinations.

Key capabilities include:

* **Concatenating Catalogue field names**
* **Adding timestamps**
* **Creating custom columns by hardcoding values**

This feature allows for more dynamic data mapping, moving beyond the limitation of sending only fields available in your Catalogue. It helps you meet the specific requirements of different platforms while improving data usability and precision.

<Update label="1.2 Enhanced Support for Object and List of Objects in Destination Uploads" description="09-12-2024">

We have expanded our platform's capabilities to support the upload of both single objects and lists of objects to destination platforms. This enhancement allows for more comprehensive data transfers, accommodating complex data structures and nested content.

Key features include:

* **Object Support**: Upload individual data objects directly to destination platforms, ensuring precise data mapping and integration.
* **List of Objects Support**: Transfer collections of objects in a single upload, streamlining the process for datasets that include multiple entries or records.
* **Nested Content Entity (NCE) Support**: Manage and upload nested data structures, preserving hierarchical relationships within your data during the upload process.

These improvements facilitate more efficient and accurate data uploads, catering to a wider range of data structures and integration scenarios. For detailed guidance on utilizing these features, refer to our documentation on [Object, List of Objects, and NCE Support in Destination Upload](/articles/segment-customer/object-list-of-objects-and-nce-support-in-destination-upload).

### 2. Source Enhancements

The below features are now available in the Sources module of Zeotap CDP. 

<Update label="2.1 Introduced New Source–Databricks" description="07-11-2024">

Databricks serves as a unified, open analytics platform for building, deploying, sharing, and maintaining enterprise-grade data, analytics, and AI solutions. It integrates with cloud storage and security within your cloud account and manages cloud infrastructure for you.

Zeotap simplifies data onboarding by allowing direct connections to your Databricks data through the Sources module in Zeotap CDP. You can configure automatic data synchronization between your Databricks account and the source created in Zeotap CDP using the Sync Frequency feature. For more information about how to create and implement a Databricks source, refer [here](/articles/integrate-customer/create-and-implement-a-databricks-source).
</Update>

<Update label="2.2 Enhanced Source Mapping Screen" description="04-10-2024">

We have made  significant enhancements to the source mapping screen that now makes  field mapping faster, more intuitive, and easier to manage. These improvements focus on refining the user experience by adding new options that improve clarity and efficiency in mapping source data. With these enhancements, you can now:

* Arrange the attributes neatly by collapsing them


* Access filters, search, and auto-mapping toggles to enable quicker mapping adjustments

* Identify data types and statuses at a glance with clear color coding

* Resolve issues faster with more detailed error messaging

<Update label="2.3 The New Source Report Dashboard" description="04-10-2024">

We are excited to introduce our newest enhancement to the Sources module, designed to give you a complete view of your source data journey. In addition, you can track file status updates for your batch sources. You can now access all key source data insights in one place through the following charts:

* **Source Ingestion Trend** \- Track cumulative event data over time, with flexible filtering for the last 7, 30, or 90 days.
* **Batch vs Streaming Ingestion Trend** \- Compare the volume of ingested events from batch and streaming sources over time.
* **Top Sources Ingestion Trend** \- Visualise the ingestion performance of your top data sources, with options to filter the top 5, 10, or 15 sources.
* **Batch Sources Report** \- Get a comprehensive overview of batch sources, including source details, file names, record counts, and current statuses.

Note that the dashboard refreshes every 8 hours, ensuring that you always have the latest insights into your data ingestion trends. To know more about using the Source Report Dashboard, read the docs here.
