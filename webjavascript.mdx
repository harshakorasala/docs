The zeotap.js JavaScript (JS) helps you send data from your websites to your Collect account. This web JS is a client-side library that can be implemented on websites to track events, page visit information, user logins, user details and any other information relating to the product or services offered on the website. This data can then be made actionable by creating user segments, viewing insights and targeting them on your preferred platforms.
