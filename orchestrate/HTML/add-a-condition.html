To do this, the first step is to define which events and attributes you're interested in filtering. The second step is to define how recently and how frequently a user should have done that action. This lets you power more personalised recommendations, push or email notifications. </p><p>For example, you want to identify users who are abandoning their carts. In such a scenario, you first track when someone adds a product to their cart. Then, after waiting for some time you look back and see if they made the purchase or not.</p><h3 id="h3_88992923">Entry Event Attributes Filter</h3><p>When you perform a specific event that meets the 'Entry Event Condition', you become eligible for a particular workflow. You can use the 'Have Entry Event Attributes'&nbsp;filter to refer to that event again and use its attributes for filtering. Ensure that you use the same event name that have you used in the entry condition, as this filter always refers to the attributes of the entry event that triggered the workflow.</p></body></html>
