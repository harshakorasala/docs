title : "Create Calculated Attributes"
description : "This step allows you to derive user-level insights by aggregating your users' isolated actions. You can then use this data to create more powerful customer cohorts."

As a marketer, you can use calculated attributes to create new attributes for a user by aggregating their event data over a specific time period. For example, `90_day_revenue` of a user, `1_week_page_views` to check the engagement of a user, `units_purchased` by a user for a specific category like T-shirts.

These calculated attributes are used as segmenting criteria and can then be forwarded to different integrations. For example, in a workflow, you can define High Spenders as users with `90_day_revenue` \> €500 or Low Engagement Users by putting `1_week_page_views` \< 5 criteria.
