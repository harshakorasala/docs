title : "Introduction"
description : "In a nutshell, you first create a source within Zeotap CDP to gather your customer data (like events from your site or app) processed either in batches or real-time. "
---

Channel this plethora of data into the Zeotap system in a specific format by mapping your incoming fields to Zeotap Catalogue fields. This forms unified profiles of your customers in the Zeotap system based on the configured [ID Strategy](/articles/unify-customer/id-strategies). You can then make use of another tool of Zeotap CDP called [Segment](/articles/segment-customer/segment), to create cohorts of your customers, known as Audiences/segments. Finally, link these Audiences/segments to outbound platforms such as Facebook, Snapchat, Airship, Batch and so on, to achieve your use case using another Zeotap tool named [Destinations](/articles/integrate-customer/destinations).
